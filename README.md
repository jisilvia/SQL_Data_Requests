# SQL Data Requests

## Project Description

This project demonstrates an understanding of various SQL syntaxes by completing multiple Data Requests using the Sales Order and sakila databases. It also includes custom data requets to exhibit further knowledge of general business concepts and the appliance of SQL commands to fulfill these.

## Requirements

**SQL.** Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that is typically used in relational database or data stream management systems.

**SQL Client Software.** A software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database, such as:
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
- [MySQL Worbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).

**Web Host Service.** A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web.
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Launch
Download the sakila database *sakila_data.sql* and schema *sakila_schema.sql*. In addition, access the Sales_Order database using the provided login credentials. Using your web host, create a new database for the downloaded files. Open the sakila schema file in your SQL client software and execute the code. Lastly, open the sakila data file in your SQL client software and execute the code to create the database.

Your SQL code is now ready to run.
